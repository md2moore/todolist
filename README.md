# todo-list

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

## Build & development

In order to run this todo list application you must install all the prerequisite packages. This includes installing nodejs, ruby, and git. After these have been installed follow these steps:

- Once you have cloned the repository, go into the repos root directory in the nodejs command prompt and run "npm install -g grunt-cli bower" to install bower and grunt.

- Then run "npm install". This will install all the node dependencies for the todolist application. 

- Then open the ruby command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the app and run "gem install compass". This will install the dependencies needed for SASS.

- Then back in the nodejs command prompt run "bower install" in the apps root directory.

These same steps above are outlined in the readme section in the github for the [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) scaffolding tool used to build the angular web app.

## Running the To Do List Application

First you must start the server by entering this command in the apps root directory in the nodejs command prompt: "node backend.js".
Then you can run "grunt serve" in the same directory in another window.
